Hello everybody out there using minix -



Test1


I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) 
for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. 

I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat 

(same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) 

among other things).
